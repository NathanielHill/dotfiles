# dotfiles
My UNIX dotfiles!

This repo does all sorts of dangerous things as root via my custon installer shell script, make sure you read through my script before you let it clobber your system

## To install

on an Ubuntu machine:

`sudo apt-get install git`

`git clone http://github.com/NathanielHill/dotfiles.git`

`cd dotfiles`

`./install`


Then copy your ssh private key into ~/.ssh and you're good to go
